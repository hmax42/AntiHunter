## Overview

**AntiHunter** is a low-cost, open-source distributed perimeter defense system for wireless network security and operational awareness. It enables comprehensive monitoring and protection of wireless environments, transforming spectrum activity into actionable security intelligence for defensive operations.

Built on the ESP32-S3 platform with mesh networking, AntiHunter creates a scalable sensor network for real-time threat detection, device tracking, and perimeter security. The system combines WiFi/BLE scanning, GPS positioning, environmental sensors, and distributed coordination to provide robust wireless security capabilities.

## Core Capabilities

### Primary Detection Modes

#### 1. **List Scan Mode (Area Surveillance)**

Maintain a watchlist of target MAC addresses (full 6-byte) or OUI prefixes (first 3-byte vendor IDs). AntiHunter systematically sweeps designated WiFi channels and BLE frequencies, providing immediate alerts and detailed logging when targets are detected.

**Key Features:**
- **Targeted Monitoring**: Track specific devices by MAC address or vendor
- **Logging**: Records RSSI, channel, GPS coordinates, and device names to SD card
- **Real-time Alerts**: Immediate notifications via web interface and mesh network
- **Use Cases**:
  - Passive monitoring of authorized devices in secure environments
  - Wireless survey and network auditing
  - Rogue access point and suspicious beacon identification

#### 2. **Experimental: Triangulation System (Distributed Tracking)**

The Triangulation System coordinates multiple AntiHunter nodes across a mesh network to achieve precise location tracking of target devices. Each node simultaneously scans for the specified target, recording signal strength (RSSI) and GPS coordinates. Detection data is aggregated and forwarded to the command center for advanced trilateration processing.


**Key Features:**
- **Multi-node Coordination**: Distributed scanning across mesh network nodes
- **GPS Integration**: Each node contributes location data for accurate positioning
- **Real-time Tracking**: Continuous monitoring with position updates
- **AH Command Center Integration**: Data forwarded for centralized processing and mapping
- **Use Cases**:
  - Perimeter defense and intrusion detection
  - Asset tracking and geofencing
  - Incident response and tactical operations
  - Large-area device monitoring

### Sensor Integration

#### **GPS Positioning**
- **Interface**: UART2 (RX=GPIO44, TX=GPIO43) at 9600 baud using TinyGPS++
- **Functionality**: Parses NMEA sentences for location, altitude, and satellite data
- **Web Interface**: Real-time GPS status, last known position, and fix quality
- **API Endpoint**: `/gps` returns current latitude/longitude coordinates
- **Integration**: All detection events include GPS coordinates when available

#### **SD Card Logging**
- **Interface**: SPI (CS=GPIO2, SCK=GPIO7, MISO=GPIO8, MOSI=GPIO9)
- **Storage**: Logs to `/antihunter.log` with timestamps, detection types, and metadata
- **Format**: Structured entries including MAC addresses, RSSI, GPS data, and timestamps
- **Diagnostics**: Web interface shows storage status, file listing, and usage statistics

#### **Vibration/Tamper Detection**
- **Sensor**: SW-420 vibration sensor connected to GPIO1
- **Detection**: Interrupt-driven monitoring with 5-second rate limiting
- **Alerts**: Mesh network notifications with GPS coordinates and timestamps
- **Format**: `NODE_ABC: VIBRATION: Movement detected at HH:MM:SS GPS:lat,lon`
- **Status**: Real-time sensor state displayed in diagnostics panel

#### **Real-Time Clock (RTC)**
- **Module**: DS3231 RTC via I2C (SDA=GPIO6, SCL=GPIO3)
- **Functionality**: Accurate timekeeping during power outages and GPS synchronization
- **Features**: Automatic time sync from GPS, manual time setting, sync status monitoring
- **Web Interface**: Current time display and synchronization status

## System Architecture

### **Distributed Node Network**
AntiHunter operates as a distributed sensor network where each node functions independently while contributing to the overall security picture. Nodes communicate via Meshtastic mesh networking, enabling:

- **Scalable Coverage**: Deploy multiple nodes to cover large areas
- **Redundant Detection**: Multiple nodes improve detection reliability
- **Distributed Processing**: Local decision-making with centralized coordination
- **Resilient Communications**: Mesh networking ensures connectivity in challenging environments

### **Operational Workflow**
1. **Local Detection**: Each node performs independent WiFi/BLE scanning based on configured parameters
2. **Target Identification**: Matches detected devices against configured watchlists
3. **Data Collection**: Records detection metadata (RSSI, GPS, timestamp, etc.)
4. **Mesh Coordination**: Broadcasts alerts and status to other nodes and command center
5. **Central Processing**: Command center aggregates data for advanced analytics and visualization
6. **Response Actions**: Local and coordinated responses based on threat assessment

### **Command Center Integration**
While individual nodes provide standalone capability, the full system power comes from integration with a central command center that:
- Aggregates detection data from all nodes
- Performs advanced trilateration calculations
- Provides real-time mapping and visualization
- Enables coordinated response operations
- Maintains historical threat intelligence
